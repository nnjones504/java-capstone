# About

My java capstone is a continuation of what I made for my foundations capstone. . My backend will now be written in java. My project is a fashion ecommerce website, with more features than before. Users can now create accounts, checkout, and submit orders rather than just being put on a waitlist.

# MVP
Users can:
- Register for a new account
- Login to account
- Add item to cart
- Remove item from cart
- Submit order
